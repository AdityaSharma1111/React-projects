REDUX:
one application, one store
1. configure the store
2. make reducers(slices)
3. make an initial state(array/object)
4. make slice(name, initial state, reducers->properties & functions)
also write function definition in reducers
state: gives the access of values present in the initial state
action: values we provide
5. export all the parts of the reducer
export all the individual functionalities(we update the state through the functionalities only)
export the reducer
6. import the reducer in the store
7. make components
useDispatch: make changes in the store with the help of a reducer
useSelector: we get access of the state in a callback

*we use callback whenever we have to give the parameters in a method
*if we use funct(), it will be immediately executed

8. Wrap the components either in main.jsx or app.jsx
